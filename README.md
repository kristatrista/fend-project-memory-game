## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
## How to play
The game shows the cards for a short time then they flip back over. The goal of the game is to match all 8 pairs of cards from memory. There is a timer, move counter and star rating that will appear if you chose to restart or win the game.
